\lettercontent{Dear Recruiter,}

% The first paragraph of your job application letter should include information on why you are writing. Mention the job you are applying for and where you found the position. If you have a contact at the company, mention the person's name and your connection here.

\lettercontent{I hope you're doing well! I am a junior majoring in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am extremely impressed by Bracebridge Capital's approach to trading through modern technology and how much it values its employees. As an intern, the ability to construct software that will actually be used in the future is very important for me and a role at Bracebridge Capital will fulfill this. In particular, I am impressed with the highly rated work environment that is offered at Bracebridge Capital! Therefore, I am writing to request an invitation to interview for a Summer Investment Analyst position.
}


   
% The next section of your cover letter should describe what you have to offer the company. Make strong connections between your abilities and the requirements listed in the job posting. Mention specifically how your skills and experience match the job. Expand on the information in your resume.
% Try to support each statement you make with a piece of evidence. Use several shorter paragraphs or bullets rather than one large block of text, which can be difficult to read and absorb quickly.
%For example 

% Using the knowledge and skills I have acquired in my <DEGREE PROGRAM> combined with my technical abilities I believe I can provide significant value to <COMPANY> while providing me invaluable experience to <PREPARE FOR OR FURTHER CAREER>.
% <RELEVANT LIFE STORY/ WORK/ PROJECT >
% In own projects, my coursework, work as a <PREVIOUS JOB TITLE> I have applied knowledge of <SUBJECT MATTER>.
% <LIST OF SMART SOUNDING SKILLS AND TOOLS>.
% Combining these tools with my interests in <FIELD> issues, I hope to help the <DEPARTMENT> answer questions about the <SUBJECT> behind <FIELD> projects.

\lettercontent{In the past two years, I have had the opportunity to explore diverse fields in computer science through internships, personal projects and GT organizations. This summer, I am working as a Software Development Intern at Boston Scientific (BSC). As a part of the Precision Spectra™ Spinal Cord Implant team, I am engineering the Twilight app, which is used to control patient therapy through BSC's spinal cord implant. Coding software for an implant that affects thousands of lives is inspiring and I have learned to truly appreciate my skillset. Not only did I use existing skills of app and backend development, but I also picked up new technologies in Machine learning and database management through this internship. I am learning how to operate in a deadline-oriented environment, and this has bridged the gap between college courses and real-world tasks!
}

\lettercontent{Passionate about picking up new skills, I am constantly looking for projects to work on. Seeing a rise in hospitalizations amongst my friends due to alcohol consumption, I started working on the Booze App and a backend API, used to track a user's live blood alcohol content and prevent any complications through alerts.I love building side projects because I can venture into undiscovered tech stacks and truely self-learn. Sometimes class assignments can be treacherous and side projects are a gateway for me to escape into my own interests.
}

% Conclude your application letter by thanking the employer for considering you for the position. 

\lettercontent{Besides being a nerd, I am involved in managerial positions in my fraternity and the GT filmmaking club. I love working in teams leading from the front. I am confident that I can bring my diverse background to best fit the current needs and future ventures of Bracebridge Capital. Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you soon!}
